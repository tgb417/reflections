    Backup.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    For the same kinds of reasons you want to do commit manually.  In this case
    you may not be ready for the updates comming from github.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a copy of a repository that happens on a site like GitHub between accounts
    Clone is a copy from repository to another regardless of local or remote
    Branch is the creation of more than one set of files withing a repository

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It makes merging eaiser for the git system.  Particularly if you are disconnected
    from the network.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Send emails maybe zip them up if there are a lot of files.  This git method is
    easier if multiple back and forths are needed or if multiple participants are going
    to contribute.  If it is a one time then email is easier.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
